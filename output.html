This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one!</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>B001APH9GW</td><td>A1E4RMHGMDEMKZ</td><td>This is the best in ear bluetooth by far that I've ever used. People could actually hear me while driving. And I like the voice commands that it has, they actually work quite well. But it still doesn't compare to the over the head bluetooth headsets like zelher and blue parrot as far as ease of use, call quality and battery life which are the most important things in a headset. But if you don't want to look like a fast food worker then the blue ant is the way to go.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>B001IATYMQ</td><td>A33IXN26NDGBUP</td><td>I gave my old 3GS phone to my son, so I wanted a good case that would protect it. This rubber case has extra thick rubber on the ends and on the back, which is great. I also like that the case protects the "home button". If you have kids, you know that gunk (i.e. food) gets stuck around the home button. Ewww LOL This case keeps the button clean. Bonus that the back is open to show off the Apple logo. Excellent value and nice design.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>B001IBMLKM</td><td>AGWXFQS7DC9RT</td><td>We bought this for highway trips after we discovered that in some areas we had NO cell service, even 911!  It won't give you 5 bars in a weak area, but it did add 1-3 bars in most places.  This was enough that we rarely are out of touch, and my 3G MiFi portable modem worked better in the car as well. I was able to usually keep a 700k to 1.5M connection, which was enough to look for gas stops, food stops or a hotel. But keep in mind the fact that it only supports voice and 3G.  It is a more basic model so it won't help your 4G connection (LTE, etc) but it's better than not having it!For us it was a bit pricey but worth it.  But if they ever reduce the price of one that works with 4G I'll probably upgrade, since now I use my Blackberry as a 4G hotspot!</td><td>4.0</td></tr></table></p></body></html>
