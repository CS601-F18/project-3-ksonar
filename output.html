I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>B0009B0IX4</td><td>A34VCCL1YO6D0I</td><td>The Plantronics Voyager 510 has been an absolute work horse for me for the past nearly 2 years.  When I say workhorse I mean it.  I put over 5 hours of talk time on this device 5 days a week for well over a year.  I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute, during the day in the office, at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages.  I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.The Good</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>B000ALY22Q</td><td>A2M66B89MYA54B</td><td>Scosche cables are the absolute best.  Clear audio connection which is very compact in size.  I use this brand for all my retractable cables and find their quality to be superb.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>B000BD3210</td><td>A1OZA52DFY3SHD</td><td>I purchased this headset from Amazon for about $80 and have had it for over a month.  I pair it with my RAZR and Uniden's cordless ELBT595.  I've been highly pleased with it's performance.BLUETOOTH PAIRINGThis was extremely easy and handled through the one master button at the top.  Hold it down until it flashes red and it will pair with your phone.  Answer calls by pushing the button, and hang up by pushing the button.  Simple as that.  I've gotten consistent call quality within a range of 10 feet from the phone, and haven't experienced any interference from WiFi networks.VOLUMEI think the biggest problem with bluetooth headsets is that they are not loud enough.  I tried several different bluetooth headsets that my friends have, most noteably the Motorola HS850 and H700.  Those work well but I still have a hard time hearing people when I'm driving in a car, or there is a low level of ambient noise in the background.  The greatest feature of the Plantronics 640 is that it fits in your ear, and is therefore probably twice as loud as any other headset I've tried.  I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.  You can also mute the headset by pushing the up and down volume buttons simultaneously.COMFORT/FITI was skeptical about the fit of this headset.  I never liked earbud headphones (think iPod) as they fail to stay in my ears whenever I have to move around.  That's why I was astonished that the Plantronics 640 stays in my ear without any problems.  And it is very comfortable as I've worn it for periods over 1 hour and have not had any irritation.  Since it fits in your ear, and not over it, you can easily wear sunglasses with it (great for driving).  If I know I'm going to be highly active while wearing the headset, I will put the optional over-the-ear clip on it, but for most instances it is not necessary.DESIGNThe 640 is small and light, and stylish enough for me.  The headset comes with a bevy of attachments and a carrying case.  The headset fits into a "pen-clip" holder that serves two purposes.  First, you can carry your 640 in your shirt pocket if you wish (and look extremely nerdy I might add).  But the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset.  Put the headset into the pen clip and you can now charge it with the included AC adapter, or you can add one of the extra attachments to the pen clip so that you can use your phone's charger to also charge the 640.  Almost all phone types are supported.  There is also a AAA battery adapter that can link up to the pen clip and be used to charge your 640.  The battery life of the headset itself is great; I've talked on it for about 5 hours and the headset still didn't die.PROBLEMSThere are few and they're nit-picky ones.  It's unfortunate that the adapter to use the RAZR's mini-USB phone charger to charge the 640 is not included.  You can buy one off eBay for under $20, though.  The pen clip adapter is ok, but not the absolute best way to carry your 640 around.  It fits in any pocket, and protects the mic, but does not cover the earbud side of the headset.  Therefore, I usually carry the 640 in the small case it comes with.  But this case holds ALL the attachments and it would be nice if there was something smaller to transport the headset alone that protected the entire headset and was smaller than the full case.  Some people have also complained that the mic picks up lots of ambient noise.  I find this to be the case of all headsets, bluetooth or corded.  If you're in a crowd, people are not going to be able to hear you on your cell phone or bluetooth headset--they are going to hear the crowd.  I believe there is a new 645 model that has some noise-cancellation features, but that is done with digital software processing, not filters physically sitting on the mic.OVERALLI don't think the perfect bluetooth headset has been produced yet.  But I'm giving this one 5 stars because as of June 2006 this one is reliable and is undoubtably the loudest headset out there.  My hearing is just fine, but if the volume on your headset or cell phone is the biggest sticking point with you, then this is probably the best headset you can get.  If you can get this headset for $80 or less, I highly recommend it.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>B000IEB00W</td><td>A28JTAXBIY8YXF</td><td>This is an absolute steal when it comes to cases.  It's not as "rubbery" as some cases.  Has a great shape, and is thin enough to provide great protection without adding a lot of bulk to an already large phone.  The only con is that the buttons aren't as responsive as I would like.  But for $3, this is a wonderful case.UPDATE (8/07/13)</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>B000IVEQYW</td><td>AKJ8QYRCAQQ1J</td><td>I've been searching for months for this package. The OEM price is about 20 times the price I paid here at Amazon.com - no kidding! Arrived before schedule, new condition, and came with everything advertised. It took a little time to install and had many updating to do but worked the first time after installation and works every time since.Anyone looking to purchase this package will be astonished and surely satisfied - I know I am. The application is thorough in design and allows for an extensive view of the internal applications of my cell phone (Motorola RAZR V3). Excellent phone and excellent application for data transfer between my computer and cell phone. An absolute necessity.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>B000KKKI0M</td><td>AOTY05YYW58RK</td><td>When I heard one of the previous reviews mentioning about this protector as a soft plastic, I assumed it was the same as or similar to the polyurethane material like InvisibleShield products.  I've had a polyurethane screen protector before and it was great, but I've been having trouble trying to find a similar product to InvisibleShield that are less expensive.  Basically it's supposed to be the stuff that is used to protect helicopter blades.Back to the WriteRight protectors, I was glad that it came in a pack of 10 becuase I knew it might take me several tries to get it to fit perfectly.  Unfortunately with my Nokia N95-3 it took me about 5 times and I still couldn't get it right.  Good thing I only need half a sheet to fit my phone's screen.  (technically I have 20 sheets) I think it's harder because my screen is surrounded by the border of the phone with rounded edges.  That makes it harder to measure the size and having to estimate the curve of the corners.  I also applied it to my girlfriend's Sidekick LX, which was much easier because of the screen.First of all, you pretty much have to get it right on the screen on the first try otherwise the more attempts you make, the more dust the adhesive side will pick up.  Secondly, there will be many air bubbles you have to try to push out.  The ones in the middle are pretty easy to push out as you apply, but the border ones are tricky.  When you try to push some of the bubbles out, it looks like is just becomes a smudge that you can't push any further.When successfully applied to the screen it looks fairly clear.  There is, however, a rainbow tint from the light when you look at certain angles.  Not a major problem.  Yes, the protector will attract dust, but I believe that is true of many screen protectors; as my previous InvisibleShield protector also did.  The protector does scuff fairly easily as well.  When I used a paper towel and alcohol to clean off the oil on my screen it left a slight scuff where I was rubbing.  None of the scuffs, smudges, or bubbles effect the clarity of the screen when I'm using the phone.  Only when the backlight is off is when I can see the imperfections in the screen protector, which is still a little annoying to me.All in all, they give you 10 in a pack probably because they expect each of them not to last that long.  If you just want a protector that will prevent your original screen from getting damaged, this will work.  But if you want absolute perfection with the backlight on and off, I am certain there are better products out there.</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>B000NLSGA2</td><td>A3TAS1AG6FMBQW</td><td>The Galaxy S5 is an expensive handheld personal device that needs solid protection. Even with insurance it is still costly to replace and inconvenient to be down a few days especially around a holiday!The Otterbox is the best of the best when it comes to protecting my S5.  It's a bit thicker and heftier than most cases,  however it still conveniently slips into a leather belt holster I bought.  Highly highly recommend for those who desire the absolute best in protection.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>B000NLSGA2</td><td>A3L0VHHFS2QUCA</td><td>The absolute BEST cell phone protection case made as far as we are concerned. My husband is a plumber construction worker and farmer and after using a Defender case on his last phone for 2 yrs, when we removed it the phone still looked like brand new, despite its constant abuse over the yrs.  When we got our new phones the very first addition was a new Defender before he ven left the house with his.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>B000Q5J2M6</td><td>AEWUCH7J8RKFO</td><td>This headset performs exceptionally well for such a light device.  It's almost so small that you can lose track of it in a pocket.  Even comes with a carrying case!Battery life is very good, and speaker volume was actually too high at times (but easily adjusted).  When speaking with other people, they were able to hear me very clearly.  Occasionally, the noise canceling would cut off my voice if I was too quiet.  When driving in a car, this happened rather frequently.In short, this headset is an absolute bargain whose only drawback may be with regard to operating in noisy environments.  The Jawbone may be better at managing noise, but it's far more expensive.  Get this if you're looking for a deal.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>B000UBNFT2</td><td>A1ATVMMJZP3Q4X</td><td>The Plantronics Voyager 855 is the best gadget I own.I do not listen to music over bluetooth--bluetooth is simply too "lo-fi." It is mega-compressed and distorts your music no matter what fancy headset you get.However, it is absolutely wonderful for podcasts of AM talk radio. I listen to that stuff all the time--and now I can do it in any environment. Best of all in this type of application, you can remove the stereo earbud and you have a single-ear bluetooth cellphone headset that can also receive A2DP signals from your phone--the only mono device I'm aware of that can do this.The only time I attach the stereo bud is when I'm mowing my lawn and want the extra sound insulation. I use the triple-flange Etymotic eargels for it. It's a fight to get them attached, but the great sound insulation that results is an absolute wonder. Makes the noise of the mower nearly disappear, and lets me enjoy my favorite talk show at the time of my choosing, while getting actual, noisy work done.If you like to listen to talk but don't want to bother those around you who may not prefer it, this is an elegant solution. They just think you're a geek with a bluetooth on the side of your head, and you don't have to tell them you're listening to Rush if they don't want to know.And when a call comes through, I don't need to jam this thing further into my ear with the call button to answer it. I just extend the little mic boom, and it connects. Others mention that this action can pull the thing out of your ear. But with the Ety eargel it has a good snug fit that stays secure.My favorite sports podcast sounds better on this headset than it does on my car, even with its expensive Bose system. Same for every other radio show I download to my blackjack. How nice it is to hear a 3-hour show in just over an hour and a half with no commercials, and over my bluetooth to boot.As you may expect, I charge my 855 when I'm not using it. I've only had it run out of juice once, and that was after a very long session of listening at relatively high volume with the stereo bud in. It charges up fast, and goes for a longer time than it ought to. If you want to listen to podcasts on your mobile, this is the best piece of hardware out there to do just that.I couldn't get any of the included eargels to fit with this device, but with my weird-shaped head, that's no surprise. the Ety plugs are a lifesaver, and you can buy them in bulk from Etymotic so you can have a supply of clean ones. You are, after all, sticking it in your ear.I love this product. It does more than I hoped it would, and enhances my life far beyond its low cost (got mine for $35). If you have an mp3-enabled phone with lots of memory (like a Q or Blackjack with a good-capacity MicroSD card) and you like talk radio, get one of these and prepare for a great experience. You'll find yourself leaving the iPod and headphones at home because they're just too much of a hassle and this stuff works great.Love the functionality this item gives to products and services I already had.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>B000UC158O</td><td>A2KJY8F5O1U5D6</td><td>Installation was pretty easy.  Has simple to connect power and ground connections.  RCA's plugged right into my stereo.  Couldn't use phone control lead as my head unit only has a "TEL MUTE" function;  it needed to use the signal to switch to AUX.  No problem, I do 99% of my listening from media from my phone.A bigger problem was the velcro fastening.  The car side velcro's glue was of such poor quality that it wouldn't stick well enough to stay on when separating the two velcro strips.  The unit side wasn't any better.  The fastening between the two strips was stronger than the strip itself on the unit side!  I pulled on the car side velcro and the unit side came apart.  Absolute rubbish.  Use a razor to remove the remains, and used contact cement to glue the unit to dash.  Contact cement is applied to both sides, allowed to cure for 10-15 minutes, then bonds instantly when the two touch.  Bond is like glue on doublesided tape but a bit stronger.Another serious problem was a super bright LED on the unit.  It is bright enough to leave trails on your vision and endanger everybody during night driving.  Clearly nobody at clarion had a functioning brain cell when that LED was spec'd.  Maybe it can be dimmed?  I put black tape over it.Unit works well.  Took call and it muted the a2dp and switched over.  For some reason the call was entirely on the right channel.  Person I talked to said I sounded like I was in a tunnel, but conversion was completely intelligible.Unit gets attention of my phone every time I enter car and connects without hassle.  I have a dash mount for the phone, so I don't need any kind of display other than the phone's.Would have given 5 stars, but took off a point for the  superbright LED.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>B000XQGJUG</td><td>A1W5N8OT55A9Y3</td><td>I have two of these - one in my wife's Passat and the other in my Tundra Limited truck.  Great operation with my wife's and my iPhones as well as my Moto Razr phone.  Pairing is a piece of cake and the feature of the phone re-pairing after being turned on works flawlessly.  The battery saving feature where it shuts off automatically also works great.This product would be 5 stars in my book if the volume was louder.  Note that volume *level* is controlled by either the phone or the unit, but the volume *output* is limited by the unit' amp and speaker.  For all but the absolute quietest situations, the volume is simply not loud enough for reliable use in a car.  Even sitting on my desk as a speakerphone, the volume is insufficient if there is any level of background noise.Noise canceling and sound quality (from my callers' perspective) is very good, but unfortunately, both of these units were a waste of my money because they are really only barely usable in a car setting.  Both my wife and I have switched to headsets for use in the car - much less convenient, but much better audio quality.For some reason I cannot change the # of stars I originally assigned, but it should be a two-star product, not 4 stars...</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>B0013G8PTS</td><td>AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU</td><td>I bought 2 of these as backup power for my Samsung Moment and both came with wall chargers PLUS micro USB adapters.  The manufacturer's website said the micro USB adapters would cost extra, so it was a nice bonus to see them included in both kits, but...Crappy Universal Adapter CablesThough I appreciate that the micro USB adapters were included free of charge, I don't like the extra length the adapters create.  Understandably, the manufacturer wanted a universal charging cable with interchangeable adapters to fit an array of devices.  Great concept, but in reality, the adapters stick out from the phone a good distance and are made of hard plastic so they aren't the least bit flexible -- and that's a serious design flaw.  It makes absolutely no sense to have a cool mobile device only to have a needlessly loooooooong adapter protruding from it.  It's pretty ridiculous actually, and kills the convenience of using any mobile device while connected to those universal cables.  Not to mention, the long protrusion can easily be bumped or tweaked and totally screw up the connector inside the phone.  Needless to say, I wouldn't be happy if a product designed to keep me charged up and on the go ends up damaging my new phone!The FixI decided the cables that came with the unit would be good for charging the IMP500 itself.  But I bought a separate retractable micro USB cable to connect the IMP500 to my phone.  The advantage of buying a separate cable is that it has the right connectors built in, so it's a lot shorter than the universal cable and adapters that came with the IMP500.  Retractable USB cables are cheap and come in various configurations, so no matter what device you have, I highly recommend you get the right cable you need and forget about using the one included with this kit.Do AC adapters come with this thing or not?!I'm not sure why there's such a discrepancy from one buyer to the next, but after reading some reviews that said AC chargers were not included, I was prepared for it to go either way.  Luckily, both kits I bought came with the AC charger, so I was happy about that.  And YES, I bought both of mine right here on Amazon and they were shipped by Amazon direct to me.Build Quality and Ease of UseThe battery pack itself is built quite well and looks great.  It's solid, feels good in the hand and is straightforward to use.  Just hold the button to turn it on, plug the USB connector into the battery, plug the other end into your phone, and you're good to go.  Compared to the battery in my phone, this IMP500 gives me almost 4x the power, which translates in to hours of calls, texting, surfing the web and whatever else the phone does.  Perfect for long outings and emergency situations!Bottom LineThis is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone with a smartphone that gobbles up battery power.  It's an absolute emergency essential and is barely the size of a deck of cards.  But having said that, I highly recommend buying the right cable for your phone and ditching the useless adapter plugs that are included with this kit.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>B0013G8PTS</td><td>A130BB7XI2FFQO</td><td>I just purchased a new smartphone with lots of amazing features however the battery life runs out quite quickly so I needed some sort of external battery charger I could carry with me to easily charge my device with.  I decided to purchase the new I torch by Trent. This battery pack is wonderfully convenient and fits easily in my pocket or purse. I quickly charges my device fully and has enough power to charge my device fully about 5 times! Ive tried other external battery charging devices only to be disappointed by there performance.  Trent I torch will not disappoint!  Its extremely easy to use and is compact enough to carry anywhere with you on the go. It has a nice cable that's perfect length to enable you to still use your device while its changing!  It has a display that when pressed shows you how much power is still available in the battery pack which is a very nice feature. It also uses the same charger as my cell phone making it very convenient to charge. It comes with a handy flash light and a laser pointer. Its fairly light and feels good in the hand. This is a absolute necessity for Smart Phone owners. Whenever and where ever my phone needs a charge I simply use my I torch and pull it out of its handy carrying case  that comes with it. I plug in the provided usb cable and I'm good to go. This product has a very powerful battery and your devices will quickly charge no matter where you are! I don't leave home without it! It exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this product! Now I don't worry about my battery dieing I know no matter where I'm at I can easily and conveniently use my I Torch to recharge my device.  This is a must have product ! Thank you trent for this quality product! It works wonderfully!  I no longer worry about my battery level. I know I can count on my I torch to charge my device fully without any problems! This is a quality device and its so convenient!  Five stars to the I torch by trent! Amazing product! I don't leave home without it! A must have for smartphone owners!</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>B0014KOB6Y</td><td>AZ9OR3FZTNHKC</td><td>I read the reviews before I bought this product so I had an expectation that in my environment it would work correctly....and it did.  It's important that you can find a signal sweet spot...most likely outside of your house...that is within 30 to 50 feet of the area where you want to boost your signal.  For technical reasons you need a separation between where the receiving antenna is located and where you want to place the associated amplifier.  I was told by the tech dept you can locate the receiving antenna further than 50 feet away but there is a cost signal wise that is about 7db...appox 1 bar on most phones... for each 100 feet.  In my case the cable length needed to be 62 feet (I had to put a 12 foot extension on the 50 feet supplied) to allow my receiving antenna to be in the best sweet spot I could find on my property.  The sweet spot was a location that was between -82db and -85db which is about 4 bars on most cell phones.  The line of sight is about 30 feet away from my inside problem area but in order to run the cables I needed about 62 total feet of cable.  The end result was that although my cable needed to be longer...the signal strength at my sweet spot was way more than enough to offset the extra cable length signal loss.  The bottom line is I have a wonderful signal where I used to not be able to talk inside my house.  I placed the inside amp box near where I previously had no signal.  I recommend this product to those who have a sweet spot they want to "move" inside.  If you do not have enough signal anywhere then do not buy this product.  This product simply allows one to move the best signal to a new location...but that location has to be within a reasonable distance away.  One more note...it is very important to take a lot of time to find the best sweet spot you can find.  Most cell phones can be put in a mode where you can see the signal strength in decibels rather than bars....the lower the decibel number the better.  You need to know that it takes most cell phones 15 seconds or more to update those numbers so finding the absolute best sweet spot is not always fast.  Sometimes 1 foot movement can make a huge difference signal wise so take your time to locate where your receiving antenna should be mounted.  Also it helps to know where your cell phone transmitting tower is and point the receiving antenna towards that tower.  This might be a problem for some consumers to find but if you do know the direction of your cell phone company's tower you can fine tune signal reception in a fringe area.  I suspect that if you find a sweet spot of 4 bars or more the actual location of the tower will not be a huge problem but it certainly will help.  None of this is hard to do and it really makes a difference between getting a fantastic signal inside to just a marginal one.  The 30 day guarantee is great for those who cannot make this product work in their location.  Well worth the money.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>B001630QZE</td><td>A2X7NBUETXC19E</td><td>I'm as technology-obsessed as the average guy, but I always swore I wouldn't be one of - those - people. You know the ones I'm talking about, walking the city streets with their Star Trek earpieces, loudly conducting business calls as they hammer out messages on their Blackberry with one hand and cradle a triple grande mocha latte in the other. These Bluetooth headsets always seemed like the absolute height of self important gadgetry to me (though I vaguely recall thinking the same thing about cell phones a decade ago). So with my sense of self righteousness firmly in place, what do you think my reaction was when offered the opportunity to try out Plantronics' new Discovery 925 Bluetooth Headset? You guessed it - I agreed right away, eyes a-twinkle with the prospect of a shiny new technology toy.Whatever prejudices I had for these things, they disappeared pretty fast once I got my hands on the Discovery 925. First off, it's the first gadget in a while that didn't require a chainsaw to open the packaging. Second, this thing looks really cool. This is no clunky operator headset; it's a slick, streamlined vision from a sci-fi future. It even comes in a neat little leather charger/case. Third, it's pretty darned easy to set up. It's not so intuitive that you don't need the manual, but it doesn't take much to get up and running. It took all of a minute to find the right page and program my phone to sync with the headset. After that it was just a matter of fitting the piece and learning the buttons.The Discovery 925 proved useful almost immediately, as it arrived just prior to a family vacation. I'm not the best when it comes to driving and, well, anything else. I can talk on the phone and drive, but my concentration is not what it should be. I've used headsets in the past but the cord never seemed long enough, and kept getting snagged in the seatbelt. The Discovery 925 lets me keep my eyes on the road and hands on the wheel, which my fellow motorists (not to mention my passengers) no doubt appreciate. It also came in handy when I got home to find a malfunctioning cable box. With the headset in place I was able to talk to technical support while checking connections, pulling cords, looking for serial numbers, and throwing my hands up in frustration as each "fix" failed. The sound quality never faltered, even when I crawled behind (or inside) the entertainment center.It's not cheap, but the Discovery 925 is still a worthwhile purchase. I guess I'm a believer now. I'm still not going to wear it on the streets though! I mean it. Well, maybe if I have to carry a lot of stuff, or want to shift that latte from one hand to the other, but that's OK right? Right? Sigh.</td><td>4.0</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>B001AVXON8</td><td>A2MW1JVA4P54ZW</td><td>I read in a lower review that it didn't fit right. I have a tiny ear and I just put the smaller piece on and it fit like a glove. I love this thing.

I dont like the belt clip it came with, but to be fair I dont like any belt clip, it does have a kick stand feature that pretty cool but I dont care because I dont use it. The case itself is the best protection you could use for your phone. Easy to put on and if your like me ( Clumsy ) you will sleep better at night knowing your phone is safe.

I use my HTC HD2 24/7 & was looking into an extended battery. I came across this top notch charger & decided to give it a try. I used it to keep both an HD2 & an ATT Fuze alive during a trip to pick up a puppy. It simply amazed me how many charges we got off of it & how fast it charged. Then after rearranging the living room I realized I would have to run a charger through the middle of the room....no way with a puppy. This has now become the only charger we use no matter where we are, car, home, work it goes everywhere. And the nice bag thats included is an absolute plus on making it convienent. And men, yes you would use this bag, it's not girly. So far I have kept both phones (heavily used)alive for about 2 days & have let it sit 3-4 days before there was no charge left.Only flaw I can find is VERY minor, even with a complete charge, after unplugging it from my computer it instantly drops from 5 lights to 4. But from what I can tell it doesn't appear to be short of a full charge at all. I contacted Satechi to make sure the light issue wasn't a defect & they did say the lights aren't always 100% accurate. But I would guess 99.9% is accurate. This is a powerhouse charger!1 strange thing that again is nothing but I tend to go a little O.C.D. sometimes. It's a black charger that comes with a white cord LOL. I'm getting ready to buy the white charger & can't wait to see what color that cord is. But it being white does make it easier to spot</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>B001CEJS74</td><td>A2BIJMB2BITQUM</td><td>I got this product the same day as I got my iphone 3G - This is the absolute perfect screen protector for the iPhone.

Unfortunately I was able to scratch the second one after only two months - keys in my pocket with the phone will do that - but you know - the phone itself isn't scratched - so it's definitely worth the effort!Easy to apply - makes the phone easier to use - can't beat it!</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>B001DK9LB0</td><td>A3CFKL4BV1EEQH</td><td>I bought this originally for my iPad, and then subsequently used it on my iPad 2.  This cable is an absolute must! We used it to watch movies, youtube, and netflix both at home and when travelling.  In fact, it's the perfect travel accessory by allowing you to take your media with you on the iPad so you don't have to worry about hauling around dvds or other movies for the kids.Honestly, we've upgraded to using theApple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A)for the iPad 2 since most of the TVs we use now have HDMI ports.  Plus, the HDMI adapter allows full mirroring while I don't believe this cable does (honestly, I know it used to not do this, but haven't checked in a while on the iPad 2).We still keep this around for hotels/grand parents' homes that don't have accessible HDMI ports.As far as the durability/quality issues noted in other reviews, I purchased on 2/20/11 and it's still going strong.

Sometimes they break and other times they don't work well.  Since most of them are expensive, I have a need to protect them while traveling or putting them in my car.This ultraslim Bluetooth hard shell carrying case is perfect for most Bluetooth headsets that I have.When traveling, I just put the headset in the case and put it in my carryon.  Or, I can carry it in a pocket, especially if I am wearing a sports coat or jacket.  I don't like to carry a headset without a case in my pocket because it can easily get damaged or it can be inadvertently switched on.  I am also not one of those people that keep a Bluetooth headset in my ear all the time.  It is inconsiderate to talk to folks face to face while you have a headset in your ear.  I just use it when I need it.In my car, I put the headset in the case and put the case in the trunk or in the center console. If you are like me, I have other items in the console or in the trunk which can scratch or harm the headset if I did not use a case.The case is small and protects a headset very well.  Plus, it has enough space so that the headset does not switch one when you close the case or press on the case.This case is an absolute necessity if you want to protect your Bluetooth headset.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>B001FVPU9O</td><td>A1QF4Z4P6D3FO4</td><td>I bought the Defender and dumped it.

This is best accomplished by reading the instructions completely and also by reading this review as well as a post I made about a fixed point booster set up a few years ago (Wireless Extenders YX-500 PCS zBoost Cell Phone Signal Booster up to 2500 Square Feet of Coverage for Home or Office (1900 MHz Phones)). The title of that review was "Good if you follow ALL directions (and mine as well)". Taken within that context, the MobilePro does what it's supposed to do, which is help bring weak or locally blocked cell signals from a few feet away to your cell phone. Perhaps the proper name for a device like this is "signal relay" because that is what it really does. It "relays" cell phone radio signals back and forth around obstacles like the walls of home and the metal body of your car.Pros* It works - if you have three bars at the window of your car or office, but only two bars inside near your cell phone, you can use the MP to bring the stronger signal to your phone.* Compact - The whole unit packs nicely into a supplied case and has both wall and car power as well as all cables and the antenna.* Easy to set up - no menus or settings to deal with. No switches. Just plug it all in.* Clear use instructions* Well made and has good accessories for mounting the antenna on windows and magnetic metal. The booster unit itself can sit on your desk or be clipped to an A/C vent in your car.Cons* The advertising is a bit optimistic about the results. This does not create signal where there is none. As detailed in the referenced review, you are really transporting the best local signal to your phone from a few feet away. That is, if you have only one bar of signal in your area, even if you go outside and stand on a roof, you are NOT going to suddenly get a legitimate four bars using this device. Even if you hook it up and get more bars than the best local signal, it's not real because your cell phone meter will be influenced by the strength of the signal between the booster and the cell phone. I believe Wilson has designed the MP to minimize this effect, but it is still there. So, you're thinking you perhaps have three bars, when in fact you only have one "real" bar of reception.My ExperienceI used the MP in two environments. The first was in my home office. I was getting marginally acceptable reception while sitting at my desk and usually would stand near the window with my mobile (Blackberry Tour from Verizon) when an important call was in process. I then installed the MP on the inside of the window I used to stand by and then ran the long antenna cord down to my desk near my flat panel monitor. This distance is about six feet, which is in the range of the user manual recommendation. That is, the MP won't function correctly if you place the antenna too close to the MP electronics. This took all of sixty seconds or so. The MP electronics takes power from a mini-USB cord, so as long as you can supply full USB load from your PC, you can power the unit from either your PC or from the supplied AC source. After installation, including removing my phone from my nerdy belt holster and putting it right next to the MP, I was able to get the full signal available at the window on my handset all the time. Now, you might say, "Hey, did you have to put your head down next to the phone on your desk?" No, I have a bluetooth headset that I use with this setup so I don't have to move the phone. Since the range of the MP to your phone is rather limited (a couple feet), you really want to have a wireless headset since even a corded headset will be too restricting.The result was very good. I am very happy having this thing on my desk keeping my connection good at all times. On average, it successfully brings the window signal strength to the handset, which means a full three or four bars instead of one or two bars. Now, this isn't too absolute of a measurement since "bars" aren't really a unit of measure, but in practical terms it means my calls no longer break up at all, my BB downloads emails faster and all is well.The second use is in the car. I had a long "work" call that I knew I would have to carry out while traveling to a family event. Part of the route would take us through marginal signal areas on Route 152 East, which is also known as Pacheco Pass to you who are local to the SF Bay Area. I have driven this route many times, so I knew where I would normally lose a call. The antenna was attached to the right rear window of our '06 Prius while I clipped the module to the passenger front vent on the dashboard. I had someone else drive while I conversed from the passenger seat with my BT headset. Of course, this meant that I had to be careful of the antenna cord while entering or exiting the car since it was strung across the door. I think I could do better if I took some time with it, but the test was to just get it in there and get going, so there it lay. In any case, the MP once again made a marginal connection an OK connection. It turned unserviceable into serviceable. Those places where I would normally lose the signal ended up not being a problem. This is different than saying "perfect" as clarity was reduced for a little bit. However, it all worked all the way on an hour long call, so I would say "success" again. All that said, I don't know if it would usually be worth the trouble. i guess it depends on where you are going and how urgent it is for you to talk right that moment.In areas of good signal strength (e.g. consistent 3 bars or better) the MP doesn't really seem to make a difference, but then this is what I would have expected. I didn't have any sub-marginal areas of "nearly zero" bars to check out, so I can't comment. I don't think I will take the time to go find one and test it out, either.ConclusionIf you have the need to route cell phone signals around small local obstacles as described above, this is a great deal for you. Remember, it is NOT like bigger home boosters that make it possible for you to roam around your house with your phone. You have to leave the phone next to the MP and you have to have some signal available at the antenna location. It's not magic, but it is a good portable cell relay of sorts. Just make sure you have some signal to work with, and it will work for you, too.</td><td>5.0</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>B001JJCUU4</td><td>A2FY4F0UKDF36W</td><td>Except for couple scuffs on the writings....there is absolutely NO difference in the quality and performance of this high end bluetooth unit!
